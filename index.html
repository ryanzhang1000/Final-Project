    <h1>The Best Video Games From 2015 to Today</h1>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>After playing dozens of video games over the past few years, I have come up with a conclusion for the best video games since 2015. Even though thousands of video games have been produced since 2015, only some are worth even playing. Despite the numerous amount of awful video games, there have been a few which exceeded my expectations. After playing many of the most popular games, I think that I have come up with a conclusion on the best video games since 2015 varying from RPG's to FPS games across all platforms.</p>
    
    <h2>15.Assassin's Creed Origins</h2>
    <p>Despite this game being older and less advanced than it's successor, Assassin's Creed Odyssey, the gameplay, story and protagonist makes up for the inferior graphics. This game explores Ancient Egypt, where Pharoahs ruled empires in wealth and riches while peasants starved and were enslaved by the currupt Pharoahs. Bayek, the protagonist and a Medjay, basically a protector of the people, is on a personal mission to kill all of the rulers of Egypt. He does this out of revenge, since they had caused the death of his son. This game is rich with a well written story, unique side quests and a stunnign background. One of the best seeling features of this gaem is Bayek of Siwa. He is a hard, grief driven character seeking revenge for the death of his son. Despite the disapointment of Assassin's Creed games, Origins has proved to surpass the other Assassin's Creed games, and that is why it's on this list.</p>
    
    <h2>14.Monster Hunter: World</h2>
    <p></p>
    
    <h2>13.Uncharted 4: A Thief's End</h2>

    <p></p>
    
    <h2>11.Player's Unknown Battlegrounds</h2>
    <p>This game is basically Fortnite, but with better graphics and gameplay. This third person shooter has plenty of guns and weapons that the player may loot and the objective is to kill the other people and be the last one alive. In this battle royale, you may choose to go either solo, duo or squad(4 people). Despite the quite long loading and screentime of this game, the gameplay itself is very addictng and fun. The difficulty of this game provides players with even more enjoyment, since it has a huge world, is realistic, and has amazing graphics.</p>

    <h2>7.Rocket League</h2>
    <p>Imagine the world famous sport soccer and cars combined into one game. Rocket league is basically soccer with cars. This game has hundreds of variety of cars. Depsite this game being very simple, it is extremely addicting to play. The controls are fluid and it feels like you are actually the one driving the car. This game has all of the rules of soccer, but uses cars instead of players. This game extremely addicting to play, it's like playing soccer in real life with cars.</p>
    
    <h2>6.Rainbow Six Siege</h2>
    <p>This game started out as a FPS game with mountains full of bugs and glitches created by one of the biggest video game companies, Ubisoft. Despite the numerous bugs, Ubisoft decided to not trash the game completely, but to restore it. This game made one of the biggest comebacks in history, since now it has over 40 million active players worldwide. This skill based FPS is also based on strategy, where players are able to get creative with their strategies to win. On most games, even FPS games, I ussually don't play past 100 hours, bu I have well over 800 on this game. There's something about this game that just makes players want to play it even more, to try out new strategies or to just try to win a game. This game has over 50 different and unique operators that players can play as. Despite some obvious issues such as server lag or occassionally bad matchmaking, this game has become the top 5 most played game on PC.</p>

This game has recieved millions of positive reviews both from the community and game reviewers with well over 800 awards with numerous Game of The Year awards. Despite the fact that this game has a lower generation of graphics from the other games, the background and graphics are still stunning to look at with a budget of only $80 million. You get to play as Geralt, a Witcher, someone who hunts down monsters for money and take on Witcher contracts. The main selling point of The Witcher 3 is it's story. The story is extremely well written and have immense detail. Even the smallest side quests feel like actual main quests with each one leading with a story about a dead family memebr or someone that they care about or just to move the plot further. The amin quests feel perfect, and your impact as a player in the game decides the fate of huge cities, small towns or whether or who wins a huge war. This game is rich in story telling and explores a fictional world where cities are in chaos due to poorness or corrupt rulers. Not only is the base story, which is 50 hours of main story, well written and extremely immersive, this game also comes with two massive DLC expansions. These expansions were considered to be even better than the actual game itself with well over 60 hours of gameplay. These DLCs were considered to be the best games of 2016 and included a whole new massive world rich with story and different characters. Overall this game is definetly the best game past 2015, and even may be the best game ever created.<p>
